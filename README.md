# File-Management-System
In this project, we will create a Simple Console-based File Management System in C++.
The system will allow the user to create files, write to them, read from them, copy data between files, delete files, and list all created files.
We will keep the implementation beginner-friendly, using basic file handling functions from the C++ standard library.
```
The goal of this project is to:

Learn file handling using fstream, ifstream, and ofstream.
Understand menu-driven programs.
Use vectors to store and manage data dynamically.
Implement checks like file existence and empty file detection.
```

```
Features
The File Management System supports:

Create a File – Creates a new empty file (checks if it already exists in memory).
Write to File – Adds content to an existing file.
Read from File – Displays file contents (checks if file is empty).
Copy File – Copies contents from one file to another.
Delete File – Deletes an existing file from memory and system.
List All Files – Shows all files created during the session.
Exit – Deletes all files from the system before closing.
```
